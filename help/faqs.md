A collection of FAQs from other docs contributors.

### Common GitHub PRs FAQs

1. The CLA check fails even though you have signed the CLA. This may occur if
   you accept and commit suggestions in a pull request from another person's
   account, because the email address of that account doesn't match the address
   on record for the CLA. The commit will show up as co-authored, which can
   cause issues if your public email address has not signed the CLA.

1. One or more tests are failing. If you do not see a specific error related to
   a change you made, and instead the errors are related to timeouts, try
   rerunning the test at a later time. There are running tasks that could result
   in timeouts or rate limiting if your test runs at the same time.

### General troubleshooting

1. Other Issues/Unsure - reach out in the #docs Slack channel and someone will
   be happy to help out.
